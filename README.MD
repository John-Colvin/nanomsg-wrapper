d-nanomsg
=========

experimental d-lang bindings for nano msg framework (a successor to ZeroMQ written in C)
see dlang.org for more about the D Programming Language

Ported to Dlang (2014) by Laeeth Isharc.  Caveat emptor.

Examples are from:
    https://github.com/dysinger/nanomsg-examples/blob/master/README.org

Please be aware that this was written in a hurry and may not be of outstanding quality.

The examples all compile and seem to work correctly.

Please email me laeeth-nospam@nospam-laeeth.com if any questions (but understand that
on occasion it may be a few weeks before I am able to respond).
